--------------------------
Apart from the basic requirements of the application, we have experiencing the followings to complete the assignment:
    A2:
    - We use MERN Stack to build both front-end and backend of the application.
    - For the database services, we use MongoDB Atlas, that deploys our Database to AWS. 
    - We deploy the application via AWS Beanstalk with Nodejs environment
    - We bought a domain vietnamsachvaxanh.com on Route53.
    - We integrate SSL to our domain in AWS Beanstalk Load balancer configuration via AWS Certificate Manager (AWS ACM)
    - We have implemented the communication channel between admin (site owners) and users via Contact support. The text will be sent as an email to our email.
    - We have successfully implemented Facebook Login via Facebook Login API.
    - We have tried to implemented Caching with Redis. But we can only be able to demonstrate at local development environment only. In addition, we have successfuly implemented caching at front-end to offline viewing and slightly improve the loading speed of the homepage.
    A3:
	- We rebuild the AWS Beanstalk environment from Nodejs to Docker
	- We wrote Dockerfile to build docker image for our directory, test run at locally and push to Docker Hub. We pull the images and run in the beanstalk Docker environment.
	- We use Lambda for 3 use cases: fetch location list, fetch location details and join location function.
	- We use S3 for photo uploading storage.

Contribution: 
4 of us have hands involved in both front-end and back-end development, however works are split like the following for management:
Tseng Chia Fu and Chau Phuoc Tuong are responsible for front-end development with Frontend.
Phu Vinh Luu and Doan The Dang Khoa are responsible for backend-development and DevOps(Docker, Lambda, Beanstalk etc.).

Guideline to start the project locally:
npm install - to install independencies
npm run dev - to start client and server
